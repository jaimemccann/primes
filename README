primes v0.1.0 - jaimemccann@yandex.com
This quasi-"hello world" serves as my foray into GNU Autotools.
It is usable to maintain a rudimentary database of prime numbers.

USAGE:
primes [OPTIONS]
Without options, prints all primes currently stored in the primes file.

OPTIONS:
-n N            Print N primes. Generate as needed.
-u N            Print primes up to and maybe including N. Generate as needed.
-d              Dry run. Do not save generated primes.
-f N            Print the prime factorization of N. Generate as needed.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
PRIMES_FILE
Should contain the path to the list of known primes.
If the file does not exist, it will be created when any primes are generated,
unless -d is passed.
If this environment variable is empty, the following paths will be checked,
and the first existing file will be used:
    $HOME/.local/var/list-of-primes
    $HOME/.config/list-of-primes
    $HOME/.list-of-primes
    /usr/local/var/list-of-primes
    /usr/var/list-of-primes
    /var/list-of-primes
If none of these files exist, the paths will be checked again,
and the first writable path will be used.
